## 🚀 About me

Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and building scalable backend systems, APIs, and asynchronous architectures.

My focus is backend engineering, system design, and performance. I work with queues, workers, clean architecture, and modern engineering practices to build resilient systems.

I also work with AI, LLM integrations, and product-focused engineering.
