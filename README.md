# Pedro Alves

Backend Engineer focused on building scalable, reliable and production-ready systems.

I specialize in backend architecture, asynchronous processing, APIs, and system scalability. My goal is to design systems that are not only functional, but resilient, maintainable, and prepared for growth.

## About me

I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience building web systems, APIs, and scalable backend architectures.

My main focus is backend engineering, system design, and performance. I have strong experience with asynchronous processing, queues, distributed workloads, and clean architecture principles.

I also have experience with frontend technologies, which helps me build complete and well-integrated systems.

## What I build

I focus on building systems such as:

- Scalable backend APIs
- Video processing systems
- Queue-based processing systems
- Automation systems
- Distributed workloads
- Production-ready backend services

---

## Engineering principles I follow

- Backend should not execute heavy tasks directly
- Use queues for heavy and asynchronous workloads
- Systems must be designed to scale from the start
- Clean and maintainable architecture is essential
- Reliability is more important than quick hacks

---

## Currently working on

- Scalable video processing systems
- Backend architecture with queue-based processing
- AI integrations and LLM-based systems
- High-performance backend services
