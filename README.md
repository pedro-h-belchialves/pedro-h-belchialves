## 🚀 About me

I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and building scalable web applications, backend systems, and modern frontend interfaces.

My focus is creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems using modern engineering practices, clean architecture, and asynchronous processing.

I work across the full stack, from system architecture and backend services to frontend interfaces and user experience.
